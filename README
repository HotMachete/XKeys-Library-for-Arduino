XkeysReportParser. This is a library used to read the key reports from an 
XKeys device. It also allows sending of commands to the XKeys device to 
adjust backlighting, etc. Just sub class the XkeysReportParser class and 
implement the OnKeyUp or OnKeyDown methods to receive the key reports.

Supported models are XK4/8/16 Stick (including Plus/Mobile versions) and 
XK24/60/80/128 (including Plus/Mobile versions).

This class requires the following Arduino library:

https://github.com/felis/USB_Host_Shield_2.0

Oleg Masurov of Circuits at Home also made contributions to this library in
that he made changes to his USB Host Shield Library to facilitate the 
development of this library.

Download the project files and place them in your Arduino libraries
folder. You may need to perform the SPI hardware modification documented by
Circuits at Home for the USB Host Shield depending on whether you are using 
other shields and what they are.

Rick Russell is the author of the library upon which this library is based. 
His original library can be found at:

This work based on his library was created September 29th, 2014.

ORIENT YOUR DEVICE IN THE UPPER LEFT CORNER TO DETERMINE KEY LAYOUT.
EXAMPLE: XK24 DOES NOT HAVE KEY 6, 7 or 32 BUT IT DOES HAVE KEYS 25 THROUGH 29!

XKEYS STICKS ARE NUMBERED SEQUENTIALLY FROM LEFT TO RIGHT STARTING WITH 0.
EXAMPLE: XK-4 STICK HAS KEYS 0, 1, 2 and 3.
